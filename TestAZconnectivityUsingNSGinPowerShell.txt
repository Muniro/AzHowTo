**** Test connectivity to a virtual machine
**** Use az network watcher test-connectivity to run connection troubleshoot diagnostic tests to test the connectivity to a virtual machine over port 3389:
# Test connectivity between two virtual machines that are in the same resource group over port 3389.
az network watcher test-connectivity --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --source-resource 'VM1' --dest-resource 'VM2' --protocol 'TCP' --dest-port '3389'

If the virtual machines aren't in the same resource group, use their resource IDs instead of their names:
# Test connectivity between two virtual machines that are in two different resource groups over port 3389.
az network watcher test-connectivity --source-resource '/subscriptions/abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-def012345678/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VM1' --dest-resource '/subscriptions/abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-def012345678/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup2/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VM2' --protocol 'TCP' --dest-port '3389'

**** Test connectivity to a website

n this section, you test the connectivity between a virtual machine and a website.
